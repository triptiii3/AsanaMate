                    Welcome to AI Yoga Trainer, aimed at advancing AI-driven human activity recognition through yoga pose analysis.AI Yoga Trainer utilizes state-of-the-art technologies, combining TensorFlow with pre-trained MoveNet models to accurately predict and analyze key body points in yoga poses. By leveraging machine learning, this project provides real-time feedback on pose accuracy, enhancing the yoga learning experience.

                    Key Features:
                    Pose Detection: TensorFlow MoveNet models accurately predict and track key body points in real-time yoga images.Pose Classification: A custom neural network built on TensorFlow processes these keypoints to classify yoga poses with precision.
                    Real-time Feedback: Visual feedback system highlights correct pose execution by turning virtual skeletons green.Open Source: Accessible source code on GitHub for developers to learn, customize, and contribute.
                    
                    How It Works:AI Yoga Trainer operates through a two-step process:
                    Keypoint Prediction: TensorFlow MoveNet models detect and predict the coordinates of body keypoints in yoga poses.Pose Classification: A custom neural network processes these keypoints to classify and evaluate yoga poses, providing instant feedback on posture correctness.
                    
                    Who Is This For?
                    Developers: Ideal for AI enthusiasts and developers interested in human activity recognition and pose analysis applications.
                    Yoga Enthusiasts: Enhances yoga practice by offering real-time feedback and guidance on posture correctness.
                    
                    Whether you're exploring AI applications in fitness or seeking to contribute to the development of AI-enhanced yoga tools, AI Yoga Trainer invites you to delve into the intersection of AI and yoga practice.
